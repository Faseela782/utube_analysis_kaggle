# YouTube Video Analysis Project

This project analyzes YouTube videos to explore various metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement. The goal is to understand how these factors relate to video performance and what makes a video popular.

## Project Structure

- *YouTube_analysis.ipynb*: The main notebook that contains data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
- *Data*: Dataset obtained from [YouTube API/Kaggle] (mention the source).
- *README.md*: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle/YouTube API] and includes the following features:
- video_id
- title
- published_at
- views
- likes
- comments
- tags

## Analysis Overview

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
    - Analyzed key metrics like views, likes, and comments.
    - Visualized trends over time for video performance.
    - Correlation analysis between likes, views, and comments.

2. *Insights*:
    - Videos with higher likes and comments tend to have better engagement.
    - Consistency in video uploads increases overall channel growth.

## Tools Used

- *Google Colab*: For coding and analysis.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation.
- *Matplotlib/Seaborn*: For data visualization.
- *NumPy*: For numerical calculations.
- *Scikit-learn*: For any machine learning tasks (if applicable).
